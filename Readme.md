In order to use this code, you need:

- An active project in your GCP account that has an enabled billing.
- A service account in that project and an associated service key (set the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to the path of the key)
- Your data locally stored in `data` folder (in root of this project). You can also store them in GCP storage.
